# Background Image Setup

The website is configured to use a background image at: `assets/background.jpg`

## To Add the Demon Image:

1. Save the demon image (the one you provided) as `background.jpg`
2. Place it in the `/workspaces/immxrtalvibe/assets/` folder

The image will automatically:
- Display as a fixed background (parallax effect when scrolling)
- Be overlaid with a dark semi-transparent gradient for text readability
- Have red glow animations pulsing over it
- Include scanline effects for a cinematic feel

## Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended size: 1920x1080px or larger
- The image will be centered and cover the entire hero section
